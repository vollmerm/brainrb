What is brainrb?
----------------

It is an interpreter for the brainfuck programming language.

Why?
----

I had two goals when building brainrb:

 * To make a minimal but capable brainfuck interpreter
 * To make a clear and understandable example of implementing a simple interpreter in Ruby
 
The code should be straightforward to read and understand, even for Ruby beginners.

What is brainfuck?
------------------

brainfuck is a minimal programming language and turing tarpit designed primarily
to amuse programmers. It is technically capable but of little practical use.

Definition of "turing tarpit" from Epigrams on Programming by Alan Perlis:

> Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.

See Wikipedia for a [comprehensive explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
